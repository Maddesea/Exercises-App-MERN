Please enjoy your stay at my Exercises-App-MERN project!

Users may keep track of the exercises they've finished with this project's Single Page Application (SPA). The MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, was used to build the project, which has both front-end and back-end elements.

Using React and Node, the app's front end was developed with features for global design. MongoDB is used for persistence, together with Mongoose, Express, and REST design principles, in the creation of the back-end. The folders "exercise-rest" and "exercise-ui" contain the front-end user interface and the back-end REST API, respectively.

This straightforward web application carries out CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions. Users may update their statistics and keep track of the workouts they've performed.
